# Getting-and-Cleansing-Data

Project Summary

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. 
This project required the creation of one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.md file.
